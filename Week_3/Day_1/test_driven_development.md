# Test-Driven Development with Mocha and Chai

- [x] Manual vs Automated Testing
- [] Test-Driven Development cycle
- [] Assertions (`console` and NodeJS `assert`)
- [] Modules in NodeJS; Getting Files to Share
- [] NPM and Using External Libraries
- [] Mocha Test Runner
- [] Ignoring Files and/or Folders with `.gitignore`
- [] Chai Assertion Library

## Manual vs Automates

### Manual Testing
* Easier to set up and use
* Anyone can do it (to varying degrees depending on understanding)
* Recording results can be inconsistent, especially with multiple people
* Almost always used in some degree during development

### Automated testing
* Save money and time in the long run 
* Require time to set up
* Increased coverage
* Easily repeatable 
* Result accuracy (no human error)
* Encourages modularity (easier to use portions of code elsewhere)
